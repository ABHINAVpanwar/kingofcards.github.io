      <p>The Tournament was 1st played on 26/12/21 from then it's held in every six months approximately . The idea of the tournament was given by ABHISHEK SEHRAWAT , the certificate was designed by UTKARSH PANWAR . After discussion among us it was decided to include 4 different card games (MONOPOLY , BLUFF , SPOON &amp; UNO) these 4 card games are played twice which means the tournament consists of 8 card games . The person who wins gets 2 points and 2nd position player gets 1 point , the person who wins most games is declared WINNER if wins of 2 players are same then the player with more points is the WINNER .</p>
